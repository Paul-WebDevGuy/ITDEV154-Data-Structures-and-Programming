# ITDEV154-Data-Structures-and-Programming

**FINAL PROJECT**-  For my final project in this course, I wrote an application that used a Binary Search Tree.  The application accepts some integer values and then performs various operations on the data.  These operations include insertion, deletion, displaying in order, searching, and printing within a range.  Most of these operations use recursion in some form.  This project was a lot of fun to make and had me run through a lot of the skills I learned in this course.
